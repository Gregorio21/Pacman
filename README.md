# Pacman
A simple pacman game I made in highscool
For it to run properly you have to have python 2.7 and pygame installed. Also you must have all of the image and sound files in the same folder as the python file (they can't be in a seperate folder) I designed it poorly but there isn't much point in changing it now.
